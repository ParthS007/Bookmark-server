# Bookmark Server

In this program, I have created a *bookmark server* or URL-shortening service,
similar to `TinyURL.com` or `goo.gl`, but with no persistent storage.

This server will accept a URL and a short name, check that the URL actually
works (returns an HTTP 200), then store it in a Python dictionary.
